//Notetaking for the assignment "Back to Basics - Calculator 1 
//What is "Power"?
//What is "Mean"? 
//The mean is the arithmetic average of a set of given numbers. The average is calculated by
adding up two or more scores and dividing the total by the number of scores. 

//What is "Median"?
//The median is the middle score in a set of given numbers. 

//What is "Mode"?
//The mode is the most frequently occurring score in a set of given.

Questions
1) Does it need to be one script for the whole? Or does it need to be 8 scripts for 
each function? For to copy and paste it. 
------------------------------------------------------------------
//The example of Return Statements/Scope

global proc add(number1, number2)
{
	return number1 + number2;

}

add(3,3);

float number = add(4,4); = 8
//Above is the variable and shows return in result how it works. 

//Example 1
global float()
{

Create a function {}
return; 

}

Put whatever it is addition, subtraction, division, multiplication, and others (); 

//Example 2 
global proc ()
{

Create a function {}
return; 

}

//Put whatever it is addition, subtraction, division, multiplication, and others (); 

//Example 3
proc ()
{

Create a function {}
return; 

}

//Put whatever it is addition, subtraction, division, multiplication, and others (); 
//This gives a result

//Example 4
global proc float ()
{

Create a function
return; 

}

//Put whatever it is addition, subtraction, division, multiplication, and others (); 
//This gives a result
